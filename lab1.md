# Lab Report 1 
**by Rosario Ortiz**

 a blog post about remote access
 
a tutorial for incoming 15L students (and your future self!) about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6.

## Steps for logging into a course-specific account on ieng6
1. **Installing VScode**.  

Normally, to install VScode, you should just go to their [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the prompts to download the software. However, I already had VScode downloaded on my laptop, so I didn't do this step during lab. When you open VScode for the first time, you should land on a page similar to the one pictured below.

*Include at least 3 images corresponding to the steps*. 

*Include at least 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you did. If for some reason you didnâ€™t do the step exactly, describe why not (maybe your computer already had something on it, maybe the department computers worked differently, etc).*. 

2. Remotely Connecting
3. Trying Some Commands
