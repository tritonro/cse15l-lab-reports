# Lab Report 1 
**by Rosario Ortiz**

 a blog post about remote access
 
a tutorial for incoming 15L students (and your future self!) about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6.

## Steps for logging into a course-specific account on ieng6
1. **Installing VScode**.  

Normally, to install VScode, you should just go to their [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the prompts to download the software. However, I already had VScode downloaded on my laptop, so I didn't do this step during lab. When you open VScode for the first time, you should land on a page similar to the one pictured below.

*Include at least 3 images corresponding to the steps*. 

*Include at least 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you did. If for some reason you didnâ€™t do the step exactly, describe why not (maybe your computer already had something on it, maybe the department computers worked differently, etc).*. 

2. **Remotely Connecting**. 
Windows users will need to install Git at this [link](https://gitforwindows.org/) before proceeding. As a Mac user, I skipped this step. With VS Code open, I moved my cursor to the top of the screen to access the menu at the top of the screen. From this menu, I selected Terminal >> New Terminal. This opens a black terminal where users can type the commands needed to connect. The command is "ssh," followed by your username on the remote computer. In this class, this username is "cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu, " where "zz" is replaced by two letters unique to each student. I found my unique letters by accessing the Password Change Tool linked in the lab Google Document. If the username is correct, students will be prompted to enter "yes" or "no", and then asked for a password, which they reset using the Password Change Tool.   
  
  If your connection is successful, the output should resemble the screenshot below.
