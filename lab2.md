**by Rosario Ortiz**

 This lab report is a blog post about remote access. More specifically, it is intended to serve as a tutorial for incoming 15L students about logging into a course-specific account on ieng6.

## Part 1 - Writing a Web Server 

Image[] <!--- Code-->
Image[]<!--- SS of Using it 1  -->  

The methods in my code that are called include:
- the main method in StringServer.java,
- start in Server.java
- handleRequest in StringServer.java
- handle in Server.java


What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?
How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.

## Part 2 - Debugging During Lab 3

Choose one of the bugs from lab 3.

Provide:

A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
An input that doesn’t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)
Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue.


## Part 3 - New Things I Learned

In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from lab in week 2 or 3 that you didn’t know before.
